-- A fragment of a language with arrays.

-- Some example Stm's:
--
--    x = 32
--    yourArray = new [83]
--    myArray[66] = yourArray[myArray[63]]
--

//Problem is that the LL(1) parser, will have two definitions to choose Stm from therefore the grammar is incorrect.
Stm -> ID ASSIGN Exp
Stm -> ID LSQBR Exp RSQBR ASSIGN Exp

//Same for Exp as there are the same ID as the first token.
Exp -> INT
Exp -> ID
Exp -> ID LSQBR Exp RSQBR
Exp -> NEW LSQBR Exp RSQBR
