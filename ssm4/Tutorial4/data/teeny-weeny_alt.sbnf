-- Alternative grammar for the teeny-weeny language.
----------------------------------------------------

-- In the Prog production we use an additional non-terminal StmSeq,
-- instead of Kleene-*, just to illustrate an alternative approach

Prog   -> BEGIN StmSeq END

StmSeq -> Stm StmSeq
StmSeq ->

Stm    -> IF LBR Exp RBR Stm ELSE Stm
Stm    -> PRINTINT Exp SEMIC
Stm    -> PRINTCHAR Exp SEMIC
Stm    -> LCBR Stm* RCBR

Exp    -> INT
