# simple-stack-machine
The Simple Stack Machine is a stack-based abstract machine, similar in style to (but much simpler than) the Java Virtual Machine. An SSM program is a sequence of 32-bit integers in memory starting at address 0. The SSM starts with an empty operand stack and an empty call-stack.
